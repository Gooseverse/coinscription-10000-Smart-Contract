- **Get Ethscription Metadata:** Retrieves the metadata of a specific Ethscription by its ID.
- **Check Collection Status:** Returns the current status of the Ethscription collection.
- **Process Collection:** Initiates the process of transferring ownership and metadata for completed Ethscriptions.
- **Get Contract Balance:** Returns the current balance of the smart contract in Ether.
- **Withdraw Balance:** Allows the contract owner to withdraw Ether balance from the smart contract.
- **Pause and Resume Contract:** Allows the contract owner to pause and resume contract functionality.

### Snapshot Functionality

Additionally, this repository includes an example of how to implement snapshot functionality using a frontend button that interacts with a backend API.

## Getting Started
